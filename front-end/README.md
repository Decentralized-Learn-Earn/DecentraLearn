# What is Decentralized Learn & Earn
Only decentralized, permissionless application on the Ethereum network to broadcast educational information about any token and get people incentivized while learning about it.
No identity or photo identification required unlike other centralized platforms.
Anyone can put educational information with no restrictions.
Easy integration with protocols like Uniswap, AAVE, Compound and many more.

# Our Vision
Education is a necessity. We want to build a community where both technical and non-technical audiences can understand the great ideas behind any protocol.
Many protocols/tokens are being launched daily and there are chances where good projects may not get due recognition. By using this platform, protocol creators can attarct more audiences to learn about their project and in return incentivize with their tokens. 
In addition, our platform can be used for any other awareness or education (like Covid vaccination, climate change..etc).

# How the DApp Works?
1. Any ERC20 protocol when launched on Ethereum network can start a campaign using Decentralized Learn & Earn app.
2. The app will facilitate them to put up content, quiz questions and amount of token they wish to give-away as part of the campaign.
3. They will have to deposit those amount of tokens in the DApp.
3. Any individual with an Ethereum address can connect their wallet and learn about the 'Live' campaigns. 
4. Once they learn about the token and takes a short quiz, they will be elligible to get a small amount of that token as incentive.
